First in auto_nox.c: I defined these:

char this_auto_file[200];
char fort3[200];
char fort7[200];
char fort8[200];
char fort9[200];
char TMPSWAP[200];

Then modified several lines within 
open_auto(), close_auto(), and appendf() to create and use those file names based at the 
user's home directory.


Then, open.c Line 63: Modified to

sprintf(buf,"%s/%s",getenv("HOME"),"tmp.FXXXXXX");


endfile.c Line 45: Made nm buffer bigger to accomodate longer path.

char nm[200];

also in endfile.c Line 65: Modified to
sprintf(nm,"%s/%s",getenv("HOME"),"tmp.FXXXXXX");


Then in run_auto.c: Included the following externs...

extern char fort3[200];
extern char fort7[200];
extern char fort8[200];
extern char fort9[200]; 

Modified run_aut in run_auto.c lines 83-84, lines 94-95, lines 106-107, and lines 118-119 to
use those file names and the lengths of those strings.
