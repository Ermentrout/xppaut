 *----------------------------------------------------------------*
 * The user-supplied preconditioner setup function Precond and    *
 * the user-supplied preconditioner solve function PSolve         *
 * together must define left and right preconditoner matrices     *
 * P1 and P2 (either of which may be trivial), such that the      *
 * product P1*P2 is an approximation to the Newton matrix         *
 * M = I - gamma*J.  Here J is the system Jacobian J = df/dy,     *
 * and gamma is a scalar proportional to the integration step     *
 * size h.  The solution of systems P z = r, with P = P1 or P2,   *
 * is to be carried out by the PSolve function, and Precond is    *
 * to do any necessary setup operations.                          *
 *                                                                *
 * The user-supplied preconditioner setup function Precond        *
 * is to evaluate and preprocess any Jacobian-related data        *
 * needed by the preconditioner solve function PSolve.            *
 * This might include forming a crude approximate Jacobian,       *
 * and performing an LU factorization on the resulting            *
 * approximation to M.  This function will not be called in       *
 * advance of every call to PSolve, but instead will be called    *
 * only as often as necessary to achieve convergence within the   *
 * Newton iteration in CVODE.  If the PSolve function needs no    *
 * preparation, the Precond function can be NULL.                 *
 *                                                                *
 * For greater efficiency, the Precond function may save          *
 * Jacobian-related data and reuse it, rather than generating it  *
 * from scratch.  In this case, it should use the input flag jok  *
 * to decide whether to recompute the data, and set the output    *
 * flag *jcurPtr accordingly.                                     *
 *                                                                *
 * The error weight vector ewt, step size h, and unit roundoff    *
 * uround are provided to the Precond function for possible use   *
 * in approximating Jacobian data, e.g. by difference quotients.  *
 *                                                                *
 * A function Precond must have the prototype given below.        *

 * jok     is an input flag indicating whether Jacobian-related   *
 *         data needs to be recomputed, as follows:               *
 *           jok == FALSE means recompute Jacobian-related data   *
 *                  from scratch.                                 *
 *           jok == TRUE  means that Jacobian data, if saved from *
 *                  the previous Precond call, can be reused      *
 *                  (with the current value of gamma).            *
 *         A Precond call with jok == TRUE can only occur after   *
 *         a call with jok == FALSE.                              *
 *                                                                *
 * jcurPtr is a pointer to an output integer flag which is        *
 *         to be set by Precond as follows:                       *
 *         Set *jcurPtr = TRUE if Jacobian data was recomputed.   *
 *         Set *jcurPtr = FALSE if Jacobian data was not          * 
 *                        recomputed, but saved data was reused.  *
 *                                                                *

 * ewt     is the error weight vector.                            *

 * uround  is the machine unit roundoff.                          *

 * nfePtr  is a pointer to the memory location containing the     *
 *           CVODE problem data nfe = number of calls to f.       *
 *           The Precond routine should update this counter by    *
 *           adding on the number of f calls made in order to     *
 *           approximate the Jacobian, if any.  For example, if   *
 *           the routine calls f a total of W times, then the     *
 *           update is *nfePtr += W.                              *

 * vtemp1, vtemp2, and vtemp3 are pointers to memory allocated    *
 *           for vectors of length N which can be used by         *
 *           CVSpgmrPrecondFn as temporary storage or work space. *

 * Returned value:                                                *
 * The value to be returned by the Precond function is a flag     *
 * indicating whether it was successful.  This value should be    *
 *   0   if successful,                                           *

 * A call to the CVSpgmr function links the main CVODE integrator *
 * with the CVSPGMR linear solver.                                *
 *                                                                *
 * cvode_mem is the pointer to CVODE memory returned by           *

 * pretype   is the type of user preconditioning to be done.      *
 *             This must be one of the four enumeration constants *
 *             NONE, LEFT, RIGHT, or BOTH defined in iterativ.h.  *
 *             These correspond to no preconditioning,            *
 *             left preconditioning only, right preconditioning   *
 *             only, and both left and right preconditioning,     *
 *             respectively.                                      *

 * gstype    is the type of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to be  *
 *           used. This must be one of the two enumeration        *
 *           constants MODIFIED_GS or CLASSICAL_GS defined in     *
 *           iterativ.h. These correspond to using modified       *
 *           Gram-Schmidt and classical Gram-Schmidt,             *
 *           respectively.                                        *

 * maxl      is the maximum Krylov dimension. This is an          *
 *             optional input to the CVSPGMR solver. Pass 0 to    *
 *             use the default value MIN(N, CVSPGMR_MAXL=5).      *
 *                                                                *
 * delt      is the factor by which the tolerance on the          *
 *             nonlinear iteration is multiplied to get a         *
 *             tolerance on the linear iteration. This is an      *
 *             optional input to the CVSPGMR solver. Pass 0 to    *
 *             use the default value CVSPGMR_DELT = 0.05.         *
 *                                                                *
 * precond   is the user's preconditioner routine. It is used to  *
 *             evaluate and preprocess any Jacobian-related data  *
 *             needed by the psolve routine.  See the             *
 *             documentation for the type CVSpgmrPrecondFn for    *
 *             full details.  Pass NULL if no such setup of       *
 *             Jacobian data is required.  A precond routine is   *
 *             NOT required for any of the four possible values   *
 *             of pretype.                                        *

 * psolve    is the user's preconditioner solve routine. It is    *
 *             used to solve Pz=r, where P is a preconditioner    *
 *             matrix.  See the documentation for the type        *
 *             CVSpgmrPSolveFn for full details.  The only case   *
 *             in which psolve is allowed to be NULL is when      *
 *             pretype is NONE.  A valid psolve function must be  *
 *             supplied when any preconditioning is to be done.   *
 *                                                                *
 * P_data    is a pointer to user preconditioner data. This       *
 *             pointer is passed to precond and psolve every time *
 *             these routines are called.                         *
 *                                                                *
