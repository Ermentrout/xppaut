This code is for using XPP and CUDA for GPU speedup.
There is also code to compare with straight up C and without any code
ml_noc.ode is a straght-up ODE file 
mlcpu.ode calls righthand sides written in C
mlgpu.ode calls the RHS vis GPU (precision can be chosen by the user)
mlgpueul.ode  calls the GPU several times and then treats the code as a discrete file and basically just loads it into XPP. 

C code
ml.c 
GPU codes    

mlgpu.cu single precision
mlgpu2.cu double precision
mlgpueul.cu  single precision euler integration specificed number of steps


see the instructions in mlgpu.cu for compiling the cuda stuff
see instructions in ml.c for compiling the .c code


Basically the steps are to compile the code and then run the XPP file

Unfortunately, I do not know how to do this on Windows since I have no windows computers with a GPU.
