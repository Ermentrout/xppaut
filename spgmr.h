 *----------------------------------------------------------------*
 * SpgmrMem is a pointer to an SpgmrMemRec which contains         *
 * the memory needed by SpgmrSolve. The SpgmrMalloc routine       *
 * returns a pointer of type SpgmrMem which should then be passed *
 * in subsequent calls to SpgmrSolve. The SpgmrFree routine frees *
 * the memory allocated by SpgmrMalloc.                           *
 *                                                                *

 * V is the array of Krylov basis vectors v_1, ..., v_(l_max+1),  *
 * stored in V[0], ..., V[l_max], where l_max is the second       *
 * parameter to SpgmrMalloc. Each v_i is a length N vector of     *
 * type N_Vector. (N is the first parameter to SpgmrMalloc and    *
 * represents the size of the linear system.)                     *

 * Hes is the (l_max+1) x l_max Hessenberg matrix. It is stored   *
 * row-wise so that the (i,j)th element is given by Hes[i][j].    *

 * SpgmrSolve solves the linear system Ax = b using the SPGMR     *

 * N_Vector upon exit with return value SPGMR_SUCCESS or          *
 * SPGMR_RES_REDUCED. For all other return values, the output x   *

 * gstype is the type of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to be     *

 * delta is the tolerance on the L2 norm of the scaled,           *
 * preconditioned residual. On return with value SPGMR_SUCCESS,   *

 * psolve is the user-supplied function which solves a            *
 * preconditioned equation Pz = r. Its description is also given  *
 * in iterativ.h. The psolve function will not be called if       *
 * pretype is NONE. In this case, the user should pass NULL for   *
 * psolve.                                                        *

 * res_norm is a pointer to the L2 norm of the scaled,            *
 * preconditioned residual. On return with value SPGMR_SUCCESS or *
 * SPGMR_RES_REDUCED, (*res_norm) contains the value              *
 * || sb P1_inv (b - Ax) ||_2. Here x is the computed solution,   *
 * sb is the diagonal scaling matrix for the right hand side b,   *
 * and P1_inv is the inverse of the left preconditioner matrix.   *
 * For all other return values, (*res_norm) is undefined. The     *
 * caller is responsible for allocating the memory (*res_norm)    *
 * to be filled in by SpgmrSolve.                                 *
 *                                                                *
 * nli is a pointer to the number of linear iterations done in    *
 * the execution of SpgmrSolve. The caller is responsible for     *
 * allocating the memory (*nli) to be filled in by SpgmrSolve.    *
 *                                                                *
 * nps is a pointer to the number of calls made to psolve during  *
 * the execution of SpgmrSolve. The caller is responsible for     *
 * allocating the memory (*nps) to be filled in by SpgmrSolve.    *
 *                                                                *
 * Note.. Repeated calls can be made to SpgmrSolve with varying   *
 * input arguments. If, however, the problem size N or the        *
 * maximum Krylov dimension l_max changes, then a call to         *
 * SpgmrMalloc must be made to obtain new memory for SpgmrSolve   *
